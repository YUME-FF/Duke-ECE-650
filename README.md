## Malloc Library

For this assignment, I will implement my own version of several memory allocation functions from the C standard library. This implementation is to be done in C code. The C standard library includes 4 malloc reallrelated library functions: malloc(), free(), calloc(), and oc(). In this assignment, I implement versions of malloc() and free(): 
```
void *malloc(size_t size); 
void free(void *ptr); 
```
Essentially, malloc() takes in a size (number of bytes) for a memory allocation, locates an address in the programâ€™s data region where there is enough space to fit the specified number of bytes, and returns this address for use by the calling program. 
The free() function takes an address (that was returned by a previous malloc operation) and marks that data region as available again for use.
